## _Overview_
<p> The overall objective for this project was to gain a greater insight into the body mechanics a major league
  baseball player uses to optimize power and efficiency in their swing based on the initial batting stance and calculating
  two different angles illustrated below.  Our data set used the top 1000 MLB batting averages of all time using the following
  reference: [https://www.baseball-reference.com/leaders/batting_avg_career.shtml].
  
<p> Utilizing cvlib, PyCharm, Math, and LabelIMG[https://github.com/tzutalin/labelImg], we have been able to make great strides in defining what constitues the optimal batting efficiency by calculating various angles of a batting stance.  We also provided a classfication range within the top 1000 hitters of all-time (Top, Middle, and Bottom) in concert with the actual batting average statistic.  Once the optimal classification and contingent on results, we hope to be able to detect through machine learning a potential draft or recruiting analysis as to the validity of impact that an indivdiual player would contribute to MLB and predict or forecast their batting averages.
